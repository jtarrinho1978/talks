Advanced jQuery Templates Applied Pratically
============================================

Abstract
--------

The target audience should have knowledge of jQuery, templating, and site architecture design to a fundamental level.  I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages to using client side templates, single page apps/sites, and how to improve your site/app performance by properly caching partial templates and utilizing fallbacks to serve a broad scope of devices and situations.  The concept of progressive enhancement will be explored with the many new features of HTML5 to provide the ultimate experience for the user and the most minimal resources impact for the server.  A majority of the talk will focus on what can be done to effectively start a new site, but will also discuss concepts that are applicable to existing static and dynamic sites.
